erlgpib is an Erlang/OTP library application that provides an interface to the
GPIB protocol in pure Erlang.  At the moment, its only feature is providing 
macro definitions for the various GPIB status registers for convenience use
in higher level applications - see github.com/kofron/eprologix.git for an 
example.
